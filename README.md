Track their activities by recording a new entry, adding info like category (feeding, exercise, grooming, etc), time it occurred, and optional notes. Flag for follow up to make sure other caretakers see it.

View all of your dog's activities synced with all of their caretakers. The icon system makes it easy to see your dog's day at a glance. Flagged entries are on the side so you never miss any important updates.
